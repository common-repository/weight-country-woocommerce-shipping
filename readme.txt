= Can I configure shipping rates based on weight using the plugin? =
Absolutely. You can easily configure the WooCommerce shipping rates based on weight slabs. These rates will be shown by using the WooCommerce shipping calculator.

Yes. Using the plugin, you can define cost/weight. Kindly refer the [screenshot](https://ps.w.org/weight-country-woocommerce-shipping/assets/screenshot-1.png?rev=1094105), you can see how to do that.
= Using the plugin, is it possible to set up free shipping for a particular country =
Using this WooCommerce Shipping Calculator Plugin you can just create a rule for a country and in place of "Base Cost", set a value of 0. This will create a free shipping rule for that country.
